Image 6

This image reflects the weather of Boulder.
Data about the current temperature and wind are brought in from online sources.
This data is then converted into colors that represent it.

The foreground's color represents the speed of the wind-- faster wind, brighter color.
The background color scales with Boulder's current temperature. More blue colors mean that it's colder, while warmer temperatures turn the picture red.
The rest of the image changes its color based on the direction of the wind.
