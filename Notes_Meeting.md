------------------------------
### Initial Mtg

Different ideas:

Change image based on weather
have smaller images make up bigger images based on most popular images on google

make image brighter / different colors based on light, amount of people in room sound,

set up iPad to take selfies

picture happy if tweet sound


animations


have 9 diffrent pop arts based on different things

Everyone is responsible for their own image


------------------------------
### Mtg 2, Nov 13

* css image converter where each pixel is class
* weather sensor/API
* params for changing css 
* Resolution of screen? rotating installations at 5 min increments (later... triggers?)

##### Milestones
* Milestone 1: how will image(s) come together/collaboration?, prototype/wireframe of design
** Code snippet/screenshot
** Use artificial data
* Milestone 2: data snippet with response/change
** DUE: Monday after Thanksgiving
** Live data: we need a web server that pulls live data down
** Someone needs to get snippets of data and share
** Demonstrate API call, pull data, and inject into the visualization
* Milestone 3: prototype => going to lobby
** By first week of December
* Milestone 4: pure awesomeness

##### Possible metrics: 
* sound (frequency spectrum, start with snippets from arduino) => motion/brightness/color response
* weather/brightness outside
* stretch: getting mood from Boulder Tweets, sentiment analysis library
